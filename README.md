# YouTube Channel ([@deepandbetter](https://www.youtube.com/@deepandbetter)) Code Repository

This repository contains all the Python code used in the videos on my YouTube channel, where I explain various programming concepts, machine learning algorithms, and data analysis. Each folder corresponds to a specific video and contains the relevant scripts and notebooks.

## Installing the Necessary Python Modules

To run the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
